description: Read core specs in .specs/ then confirm readiness
---

Read the key specification files to understand the current product, roadmap, and delivery workflow:

@.specs/PRODUCT_SPEC.md
@.specs/ROADMAP.md
@.specs/TECHNICAL_SPEC.md
@.specs/TESTS_GUIDE.md
@.specs/DELIVERY_WORKFLOW.md
@.specs/SCORECARD.md
@.specs/MCP_GUIDE.md
@.specs/DATA_COMPLIANCE.md

Once all documents are reviewed and the context is clear, respond with a brief summary and confirm you are ready to execute the next task.
